        Just a normal game of memory. Flip two cards at a time and if they are a match both will be

        It is time to amp up your math game. Every time you flip a card our highly advanced AI will
        read a number out loud. You should always remember the sum of all the numbers said until
        this point. For example, when you flip a couple of cards our AI says 3, then 6 and then
        10. You need to remember 19. After the game you will be asked to give the answer.
        \n\nGood Luck! You're gonna need itâ€¦
