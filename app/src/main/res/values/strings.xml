        Just a normal game of memory. Flip two cards at a time and if they are a match both will be
        taken out of the game, you win when there are no cards left at the board.\n\nHave fun!

        A simple game, but what is that? All the cards are blurry. And black and white. Do you best

        It is time to amp up your math game. Every time you flip a card our highly advanced AI will
        read a number out loud. You should always remember the sum of all the numbers said until
        this point. For example, when you flip a couple of cards our AI says 3, then 6 and then
        10. You need to remember 19. After the game you will be asked to give the answer.
        \n\nGood Luck! You're gonna need itâ€¦
